Hello there! You have just found my personal website. I am an human (that's me in the picture about to tuck into some delicious *Khichdi* and *Poppadams* so clearly, not a bot). I am also a data scientist and research professional in behavioural decision making & operational research. I made this website (with a lot of help from the wonderful folks that maintain the R language, CRAN, Hugo and Github) to share my (mostly) mundane musings and some (hopefully) useful material that fellow researchers, data scientists, students and members of the curious public might find useful in their pursuit for [the meaning of life, the universe and everything](https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.2057201738.9338/bg,f8f8f8-flat,750x,075,f-pad,750x1000,f8f8f8.jpg). Anything I publish on this website is expressly my own opinion and does not represent the position of any organisation, colleague, collaborator, institution, affiliate or partner that I have previously, currently or will ever work with. If something on this site captures your attention, feel free to share it with an attribution or even better, get in touch, I am quite a pleasant person (once I've had my first cup of coffee)! Also note that while I try to be rigorous and balanced in my presentation of ideas, I reserve the right to be wrong and to revise my thoughts in light of new evidence.
